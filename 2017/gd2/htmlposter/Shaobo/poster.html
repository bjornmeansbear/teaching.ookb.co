    <p class="p1">Sneakers, which were originally designed for athletes and trainers, have became the must-have items over the past decade. Suits, jackets and even ballgowns, those trendsetters could mix almost every look with those practical and comfortable shoes.</p>
        
    <p class="p2">Finally, the hit of sneakers officially showed up on runway. From Chanel to Christian Dior, they made sport shoes that no one would work out with.</p>
        
    <p class="p3">When it comes to my sneakers, black and white are all I need. Simple, full of constrast, classic and timeless, just like what I think of myself.<p>
