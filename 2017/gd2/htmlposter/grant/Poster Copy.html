      <p><span class="BParagraph1">John Baskerville, born on January 28, 1706 <br> in Worcestershire, England, was an esteemed<br> writing master, conservator, type designer,<br> publisher and printer. He is recognized as<br> transforming English printing and type design-<br>ing through his innovations in procedure and<br> style. Though Baskerville received a great<br> deal of public criticism during his lifetime, he<br> is now the recipient of well-deserved praise<br> for his masterpiece, the Holy Bible of 1761,<br> and for his invention of the groundbreaking<br> widespread typeface Baskerville.</span></p>
      <p><span class="BParagraph2">As a rule, the books published in Early H8 were the <br> works of a perfectionist; wide margins, spacious layouts,<br> and no illustrations. Baskerville's inestigative writing led<br> him to focus on the process of printing as well; he created<br> a faster, standard printing bed and blacker, more even,<br> and quicker drying ink, and used woven instead of laid<br> papermaking (My Form). Similarly, Baskerville's typeface<br> embraces the idea of a clean, graceful page. His revision of<br> old-style typefaces, such as the popular Cading Old Style,<br> led to letterforms marked by an extreme contrast between<br> thick and thin strokes and sharper, even tapered serifs<br> (Merge 31). These wider, more open letterforms, in even-<br>bisftion with his almost minimalist page layout, created<br> a classic yet comfortable reading format.</span></p>
