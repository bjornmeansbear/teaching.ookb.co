    <p> This is a site that introduce you to this cute dog breed.
        You'll fall in love with them after reading these articals. </p>
   
    <div class="intro">The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog in the world. According to the AKC (American Kennel Club), the Chihuahua can officially weigh between 2 - 6 lbs. The CKC (Continental Kennel Club) allows up to 7 lbs. for Chihuahuas. This weight standard is based on a healthy weight, so if your Chihuahua exceeds these weights, it is no longer considered a Chihuahua! Just kidding! Your Chihuahua is just not a show quality Chihuahua, he is considered pet quality. No worries, if you have a chubby Chi, it is still a Chihuahua regardless of what the kennel clubs say! While the Chihuahua is the officially the smallest breed in the world, the Yorkshire Terrier is a close second which has a max weight of 7 lbs (AKC).<br>As of 2011, the Guinness world record for the smallest dog is a long-haired female Chihuahua named Boo Boo. She stands at only 4 inches tall and weighs a feathery 2 pounds!The worlds smallest dog.<br>The Chihuahua is usually an agile and graceful dog, capable of fast speeds for their small size and a considerable vertical leap. However, some of the smaller and more fragile types of this breed can be quite frail in the legs and as a result can become overly cautious in their own movements and may even appear clumsy at times. If your chihuahua has long frail legs, you may want to take precaution with letting them onto tall furniture.</div>
