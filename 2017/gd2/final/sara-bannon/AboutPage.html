        <p><span>Hi ya'll!</span> I am currently a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art, set to graduate in 2019 with a degree in Graphic Design. </p>

        <p> I have always been fascinated with the line between controlled and chaotic, and my love of complicating previously basic shapes and forms is something that I find everâ€‘present in my work. I think that people are always so focused on making things complex and interesting that the beauty of the straightforward is forgotten. People have different tastes, distinct things going on in their life, and I believe that this contributes to the way people see and appreciate art. I find it fascinating to tap into that. I want my work to fill the person thats looking at it, and be effortless and abstract enough for them to be able to find something new in it every time it is looked at. When I make my art I am drawn to repetitive, mundane actions that do not demand using complicated means. This interest leads me to geometric forms as well as symmetry and clean lines. This balancing act tends to crank out a cohesive look, which I am happy with because I am attracted to collections of work where the style flows from piece to piece, and still manages to be distinct. Clean with the ability to inspire thought. Thats how I regard my work and I can not wait to develop this concept alongside my knowledge of the art world and every aspect of what makes it tick.</p>
