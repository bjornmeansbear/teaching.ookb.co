# Time and Motion and Graphic Design: the essay

## General Info

Please explain what you think describes what “Time + Motion” mean in relation to Graphic Design. We’ve spend a lot of time over the term talking about this, but I want to make sure that you all really think about it on your own; as well as think about how you might explain it to someone else.

If you need some help with where to start, think about all the different readings we’ve done, and the various ways we’ve discussed what time and motion are. Think about the examples we’ve looked at or discussed — what of the Motion Graphics that we’ve examined stand out to you as good examples or as embodying the principles of good design AND time and/or motion.

## Criteria

- minimum 1000 words
- maximum 2000 words
- You must design this in some way 

Format this however you want. Impress me with your thoughts and the visual execution of those thoughts. Either turn in a printed copy, email me a pdf — or if your designed format is something more fanciful, a link to where I can find it online would be fine too.
