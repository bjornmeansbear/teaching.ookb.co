        <div class="summary">
<p>Design is increasingly living in all places and mediums simultaneously and we Graphic Designers must be aware of and ready for the conceptual and technological implications that come along with this. The goals of this class are to try and clarify and explain these implications; cover the broader concepts of time and motion and their connection to all facets of a design practice; and begin to introduce software, tricks, and techniques for creating motion design.</p>

<p>This course travels broadly but shallowly. I will (hopefully) pique your interests on many things, but we do not have enough time to delve into any of them very intensely. There are too many interesting things to try and get to, so more than 2 or 3 weeks cannot be spent on any one thing. Intense practice and study will have to be at each of your own impetus. </p>

<p>Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects will be our main tools &mdash; but flipbooks, HTML5/JS/CSS3, Processing as well as some other applications and processes will be discussed. We&rsquo;ll look at both historic and contemporary examples of designers using film, animation, and temporal tools and methods in their work will be referenced to help frame our discussions and projects. </p>

<p>Motion Graphics are still Graphic Design. You do not have to think of this class as covering something else. While we are learning things about Animated Gifs or After Effects or Relativity we are still learning about form, narrative, typography, etc. Do not let the fact that we&rsquo;ll be using potentially new mediums and ideas upset the design principles you have already learned.</p>

        <div class="summary"><p>Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Learning Resource Center at 410-225-2416, in Bunting 458, to establish eligibility and coordinate reasonable accommodations. Contact the instructor privately to discuss specific needs. For additional information please refer to: <a href="http://www.mica.edu/LRC">http://www.mica.edu/LRC</a></p></div>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/courses/attendance">Attendance Policy</a> <span class="date"></span></h3>

        <div class="summary">
<p>Unless otherwise indicated by the instructor, students are expected to attend all meetings of each class in which they are enrolled. They are expected to be ready to start work at the opening of class and to remain for the entire class session.</p>

<p>Irregular attendance or habitual tardiness usually leads to lower grades and, ultimately, to probation or dismissal. Although an instructor's discretion is clearly involved, unexcused absence from as few as three classes will result in a failing grade.</p>

<p>In the case of extended illness or other legitimate absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs so that instructors can be notified.</p>

<p>IF YOU MISS MORE THAN THREE CLASSES THEN YOU DO NOT PASS THIS COURSE. This isn&rsquo;t my decision, it is MICA policy across the board &mdash; if you miss 4 class sessions you get withdrawn from the course, this means you don&rsquo;t get credit for it.
If you miss a class, check the course website. I will be posting info on what we discussed and files or readings you might need. If you have additional questions contact me immediately; please don&rsquo;t wait until the next week. You will still be expected to present or be prepared for the following class after any absence.
It is also important you show up to class on time and prepared. We&rsquo;ve got a lot to cover and it sets the whole class behind when any of you shows up late. However, being late &mdash;even 2 hours late &mdash; is favorable to not coming at all.
Since I am teaching all 3 sessions of GD3 this fall, you could potentially make up a missed class by attending another section that week. If you have a legitimate reason for needing to miss a class, please take advantage of this and let me know in advance if possible.</p>

Motion and interactivity are studied in the context of aesthetic, cultural, historical and critical issues. Students learn essential design processes and techniques in their exploration of time-based media both as a tool and as a medium for evolving designers. </p></div>
