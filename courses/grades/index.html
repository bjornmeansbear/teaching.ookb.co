<p>A+ A A- Superior<br>
B+ B B- Above Average<br>
C+ C C- Average<br>
D+ D D- Below Average<br>
E Failure  </p>

<p>Plus or minus may be used. However, for purposes of obtaining a quality point average, each grade category is assigned the following quality points:</p>

<p>A = 4<br>
B = 3<br>
C = 2<br>
D = 1<br>
E = 0  </p>

<p>(For more information see the Statement of Academic Standards in the Student Handbook.)</p>

<p>One grade will be awarded per project unless otherwise noted — though some projects will have multiple components. Each grade will evaluate process, execution, and presentation. Final grades for the semester will be an average of all project grades, completion of reading assignments, attendance, plus a final evaluation of quality of resolve and follow-through in a student’s work, visual experimentation, growth of skills, and class participation &amp; preparedness throughout the semester.</p>

<ul>
<li>Class participation is paramount &amp; should show marked progress in the student’s ability to talk about design intelligently &amp; constructively.</li>
<li>Punctuality &amp; participation to in-progress &amp; final critiques will have an impact on the grade for each project.</li>
<li>Grades for late projects will be lowered one letter grade for each class period that they are late.</li>
<li>Work lost due to technological problems will be considered late. It is important to get in the habit of backing up &amp; duplicating files. Technical trouble is not a valid excuse for missing a deadline — neither academically or professionally. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/grades.php">Robert Christgau used a clever grading scale when analyzing albums</a>. Think about these things when you are completing your work — design can be measured according to similar criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li>An A+ record is an organically conceived masterpiece that repays prolonged listening with new excitement and insight. It is unlikely to be marred by more than one merely ordinary cut.</li>
<li>An A is a great record both of whose sides offer enduring pleasure and surprise. You should own it.</li>
<li>An A- is a very good record. If one of its sides doesn&#39;t provide intense and consistent satisfaction, then both include several cuts that do.</li>
<li>A B+ is a good record, at least one of whose sides can be played with lasting interest and the other of which includes at least one enjoyable cut.</li>
<li>A B is an admirable effort that aficionados of the style or artist will probably find quite listenable.</li>
<li>A B- is a competent or mildly interesting record that will usually feature at least three worthwhile cuts.</li>
<li>A C+ is a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork.</li>
<li>A C is a record of clear professionalism or barely discernible inspiration, but not both.</li>
<li>A C- is a regrettably successful exploitation or a basically honest but quite incompetent stab at something more.</li>
<li>A D+ is an appalling piece of pimpwork or a thoroughly botched token of sincerity.</li>
<li>It is impossible to understand why anyone would buy a D record.</li>
<li>It is impossible to understand why anyone would release a D- record.</li>
<li>It is impossible to understand why anyone would cut an E+ record.</li>
<li>E records are frequently cited as proof that there is no God.</li>
<li>An E- record is an organically conceived masterpiece that repays repeated listening with a sense of horror in the face of the void. It is unlikely to be marred by one listenable cut.</li>
