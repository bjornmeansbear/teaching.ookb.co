Kristian Bjornard / kbjornard@mica.edu  
Office: 410-225-4271 / Cell: 507-301-8402  
Tuesdays 2–4pm  

I’ll probably be around more than just those hours on Tuesday Mornings and Afternoons during the whole semester. I’ll also generally be around Wed, Thurs, and Friday afternoons until 5 or so after my morning classes.

It’s best if you can email me and let me know you’d like to talk so students don’t show up at the same time and have to wait — but please feel free to stop by and ask me questions or voice your concerns whenever you see that I’m in my office.
