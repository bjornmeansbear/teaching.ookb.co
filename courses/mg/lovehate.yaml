    loveurl: http://vimeo.com/77183715
    loveblurb: "I looked up a bunch of stuff and I decided to include this Thibault video because I think perhaps I'd like to explore this type of finely crafted storytelling for one of the project. I like the motion and seamlessness of this one in particular and I think there might be several pieces of my thesis or the presentation thereof in these techniques. I really like animated infographics, which I guess is what I would consider this, I think there's a lot of interest in this type of stuff editorially."

    hateblurb: "So I don’t actually hate this video, I kind of love it, what I hate is the dumb photoshop effects they threw in sporadically. The rest of it is kind of awesome, I’d like to wear all those costumes. But I think it gets a little cheapened by the random pixelating and the buzzfeed slider."

    onemoreblurb: "I will also include a third one, because it relates to my thesis and I'd really like to incorporate it into one of the pieces I'm working on now. Basically, my thesis is about “dynamic cartography”  and how the static maps we use inform our schema of the world so I'm creating maps that move with different graphic effects to showcase certain aspects the world in motion. One such reality is sediment retreat which is basically when parts of a land mass just falls off, this is happening in the UK.  I think the moving triangulated mesh in this video wold be an interesting way to depict that."

    loveblurb: "Here's my love animation: “Distant Planet” by Ben Hibon. Created as a companion piece to the film Sucker Punch, its three minutes actually tell a more powerful story than the whole feature-length movie. It's paced extremely well, the music/voiceover/frames are masterfully aligned, the shifting mix of hand-drawn, vector, and photorealistic layers is something I've never seen anywhere else, and somehow it gives you an emotional connection to faceless robots (!). I don't know how they did any of this: animated watercolor drawings, get the shifting layers to work so well, how the “Sucker Punch” title fills at the very beginning, the glowing light effects... I'm pretty much in awe of this and would love to know how to use all these strategies!"

    hateblurb: "My hate animation is the recent series of Red Bull adverts like “Island.” The joke is stupid, the pacing is bad, the pastel line drawing animations seem very dated and are hard to look at, the constant jittering of the outlines is obnoxious (and an off-putting metaphor of what Red Bull does to your vision...) However, I've seen the moving outlines thing used to good effect, and I'd like to know how to do that, and how to create characters that can move without having to draw out frame-by-frame."

    loveurl:  http://vimeo.com/116765877
    loveblurb: "Nour posted this recently on Facebook and I enjoyed it very much. I felt as if there was always an element of surprise that kept me intrigued he whole time. The visuals were beautiful as well.  Being able to hear the paper crumbling or the sound of the scissor twirling was another nice touch that went well the music."
    hateurl: http://vimeo.com/100911051
    hateblurb: "Hate is strong word, but there are many things to strongly dislike about this video. The color is jarring and unappealing for a science related video. The music is boring and you and material is expected. Expected as in you know after centered text you are going to see a picture of the product either fading towards you or away from you. Not to mention there was a scene with a horrible rag. The Micheal Smith logo itself could use a lot of work."

    name: Zui Chen
    loveurl:  http://vimeo.com/97630356
    loveblurb: "I love this video because it uses flat design which I like, and it has abundant hierarchy by using the beautiful color and interesting story."
    hateurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXoprtDH2jk
    hateblurb: "I hate this because it has too many symmetrical elements it make me feel bored. Plus it uses some elements in real life and they just conflict with other graphs."

    loveblurb: "I like the 3D design in this motion. I do want to learn how can I make something like this."

    hateblurb: "This motion looks cool but I don’t like color and typeface… He mixed too many styles in one motion."

    name: Ran Zheng
    loveurl:  https://vimeo.com/25076865
    loveblurb: "This is a commercial video for Samsung phone. I like the way they use the 2d motion graphic in the real live, playing with someone’s hand. The motion piece things goes very smooth in the video, it is like magic. And the motion element is just using geometry. The gesture and element are connected very well with music."
    hateurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0CFyS-o-RY
    hateblurb: "Too much element, and people in the video is so weird. The element goes every where, it is without the main point. Some element just in order to show some motion effect, but the effect is also not that good."

    name: Linxuan Lyu
    loveurl:  https://vimeo.com/99341291
    loveblurb: "This is the video that I like very much. It is because that there are tons of ideas and elements, which are used in this motion graphic video. Moreover, it is a wonderful combination of these elements, such as the photos and the illustrations. It is surrealist. And I like the size and overall layout of the video."
    hateurl: https://vimeo.com/81580741
    hateblurb: "This is the video that I do not like. I don't like the texture of the type, which gives me a sense of fake. And there is not any connection between the dots and the lines."

    loveblurb: "Beauty of Maths by Parachutes / I enjoyed the various methods of visualizing an action. Usually, split screen shows opposites or contrasting views. This video shows the same action in all three screens, but shows the action throughthrough various methods: video, information graphics, and mathematics or written code. The information graphics are beautifully done as well."

    hateblurb: "Simple Shape Motion Graphic / by Sang Hyoun Han / The piece itself is ok, but I’m pretty sure this is a motion graphic  made for a DJ set. That is ok, but it seems like a generic,  throwaway piece. I imagine this to not be any different than  flashing strobe lights."

    loveblurb: "I love the originality and playful interactivity of this video. It is well timed--just as it starts to feel monotonous the action changes. This is a few years old now, and at first I bought it at face value. But today I suddenly wondered if it was maybe a trick--that the video simply mimics what it the aggregated interaction would look like. I've done some research though, and it seems that it's real. Very cool. http://www.creativeapplications.net/javascript-2/do-not-touch/"

    hateblurb: "I could hate this more--it actually makes me more curious than anything. I'm not sure when this style first started to proliferate, but it seems that it is now popular for dubious advertising and political messages. This particular example seems like it could be at least somewhat “real,” but I've certainly seen versions where the drawing are clearly not related. Looks like a lot of them might be coming from here: http://whiteboardgeeks.com/how-it-works.php?adcreative=40047268070&adgroup=dry_erase_videos&campaign=broad_match_USA&keyword=+dry%20+erase%20+videos&landingpage=&leadsource=google_search&matchtype=b"

    hateurl: https://vimeo.com/groups/motion/videos/117090919
    hateblurb: "I don't “hate” hate this video. It just feels a bit rigid  I prefer fluid motion that moves all around."

    name: Hitesh Singhal
    loveurl: https://vimeo.com/117597897
    loveblurb: "This video communicates the idea of the brand in simplest way possible. It conveys a big idea with the use of simple graphics, color and music it conveys. Advertising often gets carried away from the actual product/service and builds up imagery that may not be directly related to it. By the use of brand endorsers, celebrities and other exaggerations it sells a very unauthentic experience. With motion graphic such as the one in example, one stays away from the conventional trapping of traditional advertising and still get people excited about the product/service."
    hateurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWKzC89U7zg
    hateblurb: "This video is among the numerous bad examples of kinetic typography that has become such a big trend over the past few years. I often associate them with glorified Karoke videos. With lack of meaning, bad typography and silly effects it defeats the purpose of the video. Its a trend that very few videos get right."

    loveurl: http//teaching.ookb.co/assets/media/blackwhite.gif
    loveblurb: "Black and White: I liked the attention to detail and fluid movement. The varying tempo allows the form to be interesting to watch. The contrast of hierarchy in shapes allows my eye to know what to focus on in the animation. I would like to learn how to make motion more fluid and gradual."
    hateurl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiARsQSlzDc
    hateblurb: "Colin Bear Animation: I dislike how the music does not link with the motion of the form. The random changing background seems disconnected to the bear. The transition between dance moves and screen shots makes the animation feel choppy. I also disliked how the images within the animation such as the bear and backgrounds were rendered. All of these details made the animation feel rushed."
