            <p>Since a young age I have always been interested in the world of art. My older sister would draw pictures or practice writing the alphabet before I was old enough to go to school. This had interested me and I would practice drawing her pictures and letters.</p>
 
			<p>As time went on the alphabet no longer became letters but was an art form in itself. In high school I had won many awards for the work I had done and currently to this day many pieces still hang up in New York schools, but something was missing. After a short while I found myself in the military as a Army Sniper Team Leader. There was a soldier who was very artistic and one again I was unable to escape this dying need to produce art. While in Iraq this soldier and I had produced many works of art and helped to build a church, painting such things as stained glass and the last judgment outside of the church. After 5 years I had decided to take that drive and get out of the military to chance my one true passion, Art!</p>
 
			<p>Since times have changed, so have I, although there are many fields in art I find myself more and more interested in the design world. Constantly reading and seeing what's out there. To be competent you need to seek self-improvement and as a graphic design I strive to do that every day. I am currently a student at ESU for art and design and will graduate in 2013, which I will than move on to a graduate program for graphic design.</p>
