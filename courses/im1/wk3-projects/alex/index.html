                it is the city of aviation, but there is an abundance of people who live there
                who have failed to take flight. There is not much to do there except for eating 
                and drinking but I enjoy both of those things in the conventional sense but I desired more.
                Alexander is attempting to pursue his dreams of finding himself in a place not that familiar.
