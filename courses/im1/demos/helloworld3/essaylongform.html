            <h2>Beginnings —&nbsp;Digital Literacy</h2>
            <p>We’ve been talking about Digital Literacy and what that means from a graphic design point of view. I still don’t really have a definition for the department, in terms of what this means from a holistic pedagogy point of view, but I think I’ve honed in on something.</p>
            <p><em>Digital Literacy has to do with being comfortable moving between mediums.</em></p>
            <p>With that as a jumping off point, I spent the last few months trying to literally move content back and forth between mediums —&nbsp;print, web, etc. This was partially to solve deficiencies I see in traditional publishing workflows, and partially as a metaphor for how we as a design department can enable communication between each other, between our classes, and between the students.</p>
            <p>The work I typically do is in the realms of publishing content: books, magazines, websites … Typically this content originates with a client, they write it (typically in Microsoft Word, maybe pages, maybe google docs) and then that client copies and pastes it into their website (probably powered with wordpress or drupal, so some sort of WYSIWYG form and other metadata fields are used), or sends me said word doc and I put it into InDesign. As a workflow this works fine, as long as you never want to use that content somewhere else again. These are one-directional workflows typically. Edits require me exporting a PDF and then entering in corrections to my INDD file. For the website, if they rewrite something while they are entering it into the creation forms, that means the content on the website is the “new” and “correct” content, no longer their word doc.</p>
            <p>This was the initial impetus for the direction of my work: How do you make this workflow not just one directional? How do I give back “control” of the content to a client? How can content be shared across tools even if that tool isn’t really meant for sharing?</p>
            <h2>Some Background.</h2>
            <p>I’m going quickly provide some techy, jargon-y information for a second. It is somewhat necessary to provide you with the right point of view and reasoning for everything else that follows. Bear with me.</p>
            <h2>COPE/CAPE</h2>
            <p>People have been working on trying to make content reusable for a while. However, the semi-recent rise in all things social and mobile (I have an app for that…) has reinvigorated interest in reusable content.</p>
            <p>Most things I hear being discussed around reusable content are based on a model called “COPE”. This stands for Create Once Publish Everywhere. NPR is considered the current “hero” in implementing this idea. About a decade ago NPR built out a system for entering in the stories they cover. This content entry system was standardized. They then standardized a common API for all their services to ask for content with. The entry system provides a tool for ordered content creation that asks the content creator for all sorts of metadata about their piece —&nbsp;the title, the date, various lengths of teasers, associated images, associated references, video links, etc. NPR built a tool allow for this entry, store all the parts together, and allow assembly in whatever forms they want/need afterward.</p>
            <p>[reference this somehow?]</p>
            <p>This works well for NPR. They maintain their own standard method of creation. It allows for editing content after the fact and having those edits update everywhere — websites, apps, affiliate tools, etc. But NPR’s system is “limited” in that everything has to originate in their system. You still have to enter the content into the system at the beginning … It is only afterward that NPR’s content is able to easily disseminate outward where it is desired.</p>
            <p>While this works well for NPR, I don’t think it takes into account how a large portion of companies and people actually work. With more distributed models of work, or client-designer type relationships, it isn’t likely that everyone will have one master backend to create everything with. Creation tools aren’t always universally shared.</p>
            <p>I’ve been experimenting with a philosophy I’m calling CAPE — Create Anywhere, Publish Everywhere. This is a much more fluid, friendlier ideology in regards to content creation (though I’ve gotten pretty hung up on an idea I call “pure content”, but more on that later)… It’s sort of an ideology in one respect, and then methodologies and systems for working with content.</p>
            <p>CAPE declares that regardless of the tool used to create the content, there should be someway to get that content out in a universally translatable form and send it somewhere else. CAPE asks that there be fluid and continuous sharing of edits between connected users and their tools.</p>
            <p>Currently there is little that respects these ideals, especially from a print perspective.</p>
            <h2>Data Formats</h2>
            <p>Fluid back and forth in digital realms is common. This is (partially) due to the fact that the many kinds of packages data might come in are easily translatable. Translating these data formats from one to another isn’t like translating a spoken or written language. There isn’t need for interpretation, implied meaning, or whether or not an idiom exists. When data formats change it is literally just in how the data in encapsulated. The data remains (for the most part) unaffected.</p>
            <h3>Types of Data…</h3>
            <p>YAML, JSON, XML — there are more, but I’m just gonna briefly show you these as they illustrate my point nicely, and I actually use all of them for various things.</p>
            <p>YAML — this is a pretty format. As a designer I respect its simple structure and basic, list hierarchy for defining parent/child relationships. It would be the data format of choice for those like Dieter Rams and Mies van der Rohe.</p>
            <p>[here is what yaml looks like]</p>
            <p>JSON - the current format of most APIs right now. Again, its fairly simple, and mainly looks like YAML, except it has more brackets. Facebook, Google, and a variety of other services and applications use JSON for data and content delivery.</p>
            <p>[here is what JSON looks like]</p>
            <p>XML —&nbsp;Extensible Markup Language. XML is from the same roots as HTML, you write it in a similar way. But it is stricter in adherence to rules. Open a tag, you have to close that tag. However, you can literally make up any tags you want or need.</p>
            <p>[here is what XML looks like]</p>
            <p>The nice part is that any one of these can be converted to the other flawlessly. So, whatever format you need you can just convert it. Simple, painless, fantastic.</p>
            <p>Try that with a word doc, a pdf, or an indesign file —&nbsp;or a physical book for that matter.</p>
            <h2>Why is this important? (or, CAPE’s Relationship to Design Pedagogy)</h2>
            <p>I’ve been envisioning it as a metaphor for some of the things we’ve been talking about as a department.</p>
            <h2>3 Quick Examples.</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Green Acres...</li>
            <li>Facebook to Indesign… (need a better web to indd)</li>
            <li>Grad Show Site</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>“Pure” Content - An Ideal.</h2>
            <h2>What this means.</h2>
            <h2>Problems?</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Currently, anything built on the word paradigm or that incorporates styling (pages, google doc, open office, rich text, pdf, etc.) freezes out that as a content creation option. Plaintext is king.</li>
            <li>Clunky amount of steps, Desktop publishing bits still the weak link.</li>
            <li>Requires massive technical knowledge currently</li>
            <li>???</li>

            <h3>Transcript of my monologue</h3>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <p>? … make sure your content has all the metadata it needs for any possible use scenario. This is fine, but requires a lot of planning up front as to what kinds of metadata one must collect …</p>
            <p>This works fine for NPR</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>for the most part, their uses are fairly immediate —&nbsp;news stories don’t often get edited for weeks or months while designers are also trying to lay the same content out… NPR is at somewhat of an advantage since little of their content is printed, everything that accesses their content easily accesses data...</p>
            <p>It’s an interesting paradigm for getting things to where you need them.</p>
            <p>With COPE an edited text can still show up on a website as the new, edited text. The newest version can just automatically show up on the website or wherever. But if you are working in Indesign and Word, there is no real way for them to fluidly talk to each other when an edit happens in one place while someone else is working in the other.</p>
            <p>NPR’s COPE strategy must be created with their specific tool. But this isn’t the way that everyone really works in our designer/client or student/professor, etc. world.</p>
            <p>I thought it could be taken further. The COPE model still relies on the idea that the content must be created with one, master tool. That isn’t really the way most people work…</p>
            <p>CREATE ANYWHERE, PUBLISH EVERYWHERE attempts to tackle this. There isn’t just one master pipeline from the content to the various use cases. CAPE is rather about flowing from use-to-use, place-to-place, and tool-to-tool, regardless of what platform you initiated you the content with. Content creators should use (within reason) what they are comfortable with…</p>
            <p>That’s the general thinking that has inspired where I’ve moved to since.</p>
            <h2>First uses.</h2>
            <p>Where did i start?</p>
            <p>What have I done?</p>
            <p>What did I do?</p>
            <p>One things that frustrates me when I am working on a project is that once s</p>
            <p>writing and editing takes place in one set of tools and then designing takes place in a separate set of tools. Once the written content goes into the design tools, that content becomes un-editable (for the most part) from the writer/editor’s point of view… That content becomes locked into InDesign. There isn’t an easy way to get edits that then happen into InDEsign back out into a word file again. There isn’t a separation between the style and the structure of the content. The client sort of loses control, ownership over their content as the most correct version is stuck in indesign.</p>
            <p>this is important for CAPE content flow. the content must be “free” to move between creation tools so that the newest, most correct, up to date version is easily available to all collaborating.</p>
            <p>One of the first things I did in relation to this was try this on a book I had done. I worked on a book called Green Acres. I have the indesign files which contain all the most correct content. All the edits, etc. for press were made into the indesign file directly. Sue Spaid, the author, no longer controls the corrected, up to date, vetted, edited, fact checked, proof-read, versions of her text. I do. If sue wants to use this content somewhere else, she can’t! We also had talked about how to make the book into a website, how to publish it in digital forms, and that isn’t incredibly easy directly from InDesign either… (it is, but not in forms that I find meaningful, valuable, or future friendly).</p>
            <p>Initially i just tried to explore how to unlock this content from the indesign file. Keeping the structure, but losing the styles. InDesign uses a form of XML as the underlying way that it renders stuff…</p>
            <p>Indesign will actually let you mark up all the content in a document as XML and then export it as a valid XML file that other things can use. (XML can also be imported into indesign, but more on that later). So, I was able to export the texts from indesign as an XML file. This allowed me to go through this document, take this text that had gotten locked up into indesign, and push it back out into a form that can be reused. It is just data and text —&nbsp;just the content. I could then take that and apply a webpage template to it. You could foreseeably then do a custom app, or another book with different page sizes, or make 10000 tweets that document every sentences individually, or turn it back into word documents…</p>
            <p>The content is allowed to become “free” again. Not just converting content from indexing to a website, but actually make the content available to anything. Just the content, just some metadata, just the images… This is what I’ve started calling “pure content”.</p>
            <h2>Data Formats.</h2>
            <p>This isn’t completely important as a designer. At the end of the day I would foresee all this CAPE stuff as more or less automated that the user just makes work (like how you don’t know how indesign works behind the scenes, but you click on a few things and then the typeface you want changes.) you’d click on a few things, gears would turn, and your content shows up where you want it….</p>
            <p>Data formats are important from a data flow, a data sharing point of view.</p>
            <p>Word and Indesign display content by mixing up presentation and content into a proprietary, messy, mashup of code and text. It’s proprietary and uses dirty code to make it look the way it does… The way they work is actually with custom versions of XML.</p>
            <p>~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>This is XML. [Show XML].</p>
            <p>It stands for extensible markup language. It’s like HTML, but for data organizing rather than marking up things for visual display in a browser. Each tagged thing becomes the content available to be shown or hidden and dynamically styled.</p>
            <p>[Simple ID card example.]</p>
            <p>[Then show complicated Green Acres Example.]</p>
            <p>XML is one data format. But XML is easy to turn into other things. JSON for example. Or YAML. Or a variety of other things. The web is used to converting things from one thing to another, whatever is best for a specific use case.</p>
            <p>JSON is currently the main thing going on from an API point of view. For example, you can get a json feed from FAcebook’s graph API to show an array of info on all the photos a person has, or just the data about their user account.</p>
            <p>[show Facebook json]</p>
            <p>[convert it to a few things]</p>
            <p>but this isn’t about data formats… it’s about using them</p>
            <p>[import it to indesign]</p>
            <p>What these data formats have going for them is that they are structured but not styled. The content is pure. They provide hierarchy and various metadata (other details) about the content of something.</p>
            <p>A lot of data collection and distribution, not just on the web, works this way —&nbsp;using some sort of simple, structured data format.</p>
            <p>This relies on the content maintaining cleanliness however. You can technically get data-feeds from websites that could potentially be used in a similar way (RSS feeds are &lt;XML&gt; for example), but sites or forms that employ WYSIWYG editors often destroy the cleanliness of the content by mixing structure and style. This screws up easily flowing content from one source to another as all the styling data comes along too.</p>
            <p>Microsoft Word and Indesign are not great from a content flow perspective because they add too much other stuff into the content. While they technically use XML to markup a page, they don’t do it in a clean, content-friendly way.</p>
            <p>[show a word doc when viewed in textmate]</p>
            <p>[show an INDD when viewed in textmate]</p>
            <p>Word and Indesign basically wrap tags around linking to an image, or changing a typeface, or etc. Various tags allow the software to hang styling onto things. However, their ability to hang styling isn’t separated, like HTML/CSS, its integrated, like old fashioned in-line styles on the web.</p>
            <p>This is why the flow of data works much better on the web. Word and Indesign inherently forces styling into your structure as soon as you start working in the program. They are proprietary codes only meant to be used in the context of indesign or word…</p>
            <p>you go through all this trouble, you get your book designed in indesign. Now what? Well, you then go through, tag everything, create the XML hierarchy, create the data structure. You end up sort of building this XML file that has the right structure, and then you can export it, then suddenly you have content again that is usable in other places.</p>
            <p>[here is the indesign file]</p>
            <p>[here is it tagged all up]</p>
            <p>[here is the XML]</p>
            <p>[here is a website that uses the same content]</p>
            <p>[Now go back from Facebook JSON to indd.]</p>
            <p>This is starting to try and use indesign as a content creation, content editing, content design tool without having to copy/paste… it unlocks the content.</p>
            <p>why is this important? when things get locked up into these places, they cease being sharable, they cease being easily editable. Sometimes you end up locking out the writer/editor from the end result. The person that should edit the thing from a content perspective loses access as the content is now in the format in the tool of the designer…</p>
            <p>In the traditional sense of text content this is problematic. The web is a little freer in sharing and fluidity. Generally because data is data —&nbsp;other than the WYSIYG sort… WYSIWYG does the same things that INDD and DOC do. Forcing stylistic stuff into the content which then is hard to strip out later on.</p>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <p>its about designing tools…</p>
            <p>programming/coding allows you to use design to make tools that allow you to make other designs… or to make your design easier… or to make design for you… or to make more tools…</p>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <p>HTML/CSS relationship —&nbsp;HTML is content, again, structured content, and once rendered in the browser, doesn’t really have any styling except what is applied by style sheets.</p>
            <p>[show html w/ CSS on, then HTML w/ CSS off]</p>
            <p>That’s a good example of pure(ish) content, and then a design tool that allows for flexibility, for fluid transfer of content, for CAPE.</p>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <p>Up in the section where I am describing cape, maybe add a few more points?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>CAPE asks that everything becomes an API</li>
            <li>Versioning. This doesn’t have to be something like git, where you can distributedly work on projects. I just mean something that allows you to painlessly move forward and backward in a file’s or project’s lifespan, and also tracks when and what was changed. Dropbox allows for this somewhat if you have the “packrat” feature on —&nbsp;you don’t have to use software Version Control paradigms.</li>
            <li>Openness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <p>It’s funny that this is so tech-burdened, because I didn’t mean that to be the point. What I am really after is open communication. Open communication between people, groups of physical people, virtual people, and even a single person … If your content is more available, its easier to communicate. The precepts can be applied directly to workflows, files, and technology, but it can also be applied to interactions.</p>
            <p>Our department has a few problems with communication. The main one being that we are not all in Brown at the same time. The times when different faculty schedules overlap is usually times when those faculty in their classes. This means that generally there is little room for accidental connections to be made by the free sharing of content. It gets locked into each of us, each of our classrooms, each of our offices… but it isn’t allowed to just flow between us, migrate, transfer, translate, be reused, edited, updated…</p>
            <p>CAPE as technology doesn’t necessarily solve people communicating. It might make it easier for us to reuse each other’s documents and content in various ways, but it doesn’t make communication happen. CAPE adopted as a philosophy for interacting and for thinking about content might though. CAPE at its heart is just about sharing. Sharing time, sharing ideas, sharing solutions. At first it might have to be “constructed,” the same way I’ve been building a digital tool for automating data connections, we might have to ask each other to share… But just as eventually the technological connections will just happen in the background, habits form, cultures change, and an environment of sharing can be built.</p>
            <p>Our disparate offices and schedules make us like Word and Indesign. Our ideas, thoughts —&nbsp;our content —&nbsp;gets locked out of other people’s uses.</p>
            <p>»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»</p>
            <h4>Collaboration is important.</h4>
            <p>I don’t mean that you have to be in direct collaboration with someone, directly connected on a project or idea, but that the possibility for collaboration and cross-pollination exists…</p>
            <h4>Bounded Systems.</h4>
            <p>Everything within the bounds of the system you’re working with must be able to share and co-edit data, the content.</p>
            <h4>Pure Content.</h4>
            <p>I have a few ways I’ve decided to do this for myself. However, just like cape is as much philosophy as a tool, Pure Content is a way of making content, not a specific file format. Any form of structure without style, and any form of plain-text will work. Separation of the form and the content. In cape, this means you probably have aesthetic templates, you’ll have various places data/content lives, and then you’ll have a system to put them all together…</p>
            <p>This is important for content creators to keep ownership of their content. It also empowers rapid creation and group editing.</p>
            <h4>MetaData</h4>
            <p>Meta data on the web is often added by various addendum fields to a content creation form. Some of these are automatic (like creation time, and hidden from the user) and some are manual (like a title or categories). Most metadata on the web is mostly “pure” and reusable. Meta data from a word/indd. perspective is typically added through visual hierarchy. You know the title is the title because its in a bigger or bolder font selection, not because its called out as a “title” with some data-signifier. This makes the metadata useless from a reusability point of view.</p>
