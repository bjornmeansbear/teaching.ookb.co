        <h1> What Up</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rachel Avallone. My favorite food is green apples and I love wolves. I have travelled and spent a lot of time in Spain, England, and Central and South America. I have lived in and around Baltimore for a while and I love it here. Especailly the music and art scene. I love running and hiking and recently hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru with my brother and cousins. I was born in San Diego and used to love going to Sea World. I was once chosen out of the crowd at the Shamu show to "meet" the whale and got to put my arm inside her mouth and pet her tongue. They do not let people do this anymore</p>
