                <h3> For the last 4 years I have fumbled, struggled and survived the professional world of design.</h3>
        <p>Working in different kind of organisations gave me a diversified learning experience. At Ogilvy and Mather, New Delhi, I got first hand experience of how large-scale national campaigns are rolled out. At the daily newspaper office, Times of India, I learnt the virtues of speed and efficiency. At Fisheye Design working in a small team of three designers, helped me learn useful skills like client management and print production. Working at a digital startup, Repindia in New Delhi, gave me exposure to new platforms in social media and interaction design.

Here, you will find a selection of my work done professionally as well as at school. I will love to hear from you. Do write to me on hsinghal@mica.edu
