            <section>
              <p>I will be following the principle: “Repetition is the mother of learning” for this class.</p>
              <p>I’m teaching this class based on the assumption that everyone is starting with a blank page. Presumably you all have different interactions already with some or all of what we’ll be covering, however, since you’ll all be at different places I am going to march ahead on one path so we can all be together at least at first. This will insure that everyone knows the same best practices, the same standards of coding (both in writing and in use), and we should then all be able to help each other troubleshoot.</p>
              <p>We’re going to learn everything the HTML5 syntax &amp; semantics way. This means that I’m going to tell you what is correct today (and moving forward) (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;div id=“header”&gt;</code> for example), not what was correct or okay 5 or 10 years ago, but is deprecated today. Now, the things that were correct 10 years ago and still correct and forward friendly today we’ll discuss too… That’s actually most web things.</p>

              <h2>Day 1 Schedule.</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Intro.</li>
                <li>Hello World 1.</li>
                <li>Why are you all taking this class? What do you want to accomplish (besides just “learn HTML/CSS”)?</li>
                <li>Syllabus and course overview.</li>
                <li>Lecture on basics of the internet.</li>
                <li>Lecture on HTML semantics (basic elements, we’ll get into more HTML5 elements, more hierarchy, and Markdown next week)</li>
                <li>Hello World 2.</li>
                <li>Homework for next week.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make 6 more pages like this one we just made today. Have different content on each page —&nbsp;next week we’ll talk about links, make a navigation bar, and then link them all together. Use the tags we talked about today. You can look up other HTML5 tags if you want as well… (<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, etc.). Next week we will critique your code cleanliness and discuss any questions people have based on this exercise.</li>
                    <li>Love/Hate » send me 2 links by 8:00am next Tuesday the 9th. One link to a site whose design and/or functionality you love, and one link to a site whose design or functionality you hate… Be prepared to explain your choices to the class.</li>
                  </ul>

              <h3>Hello World 1:</h3>
              <p>Just do an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, and then an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code><br />
              That’s a good place to start this discussion and see what people already know.</p>
              <h3>Hello World 2:</h3>
              <p>Add html doctype. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, and then also do a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area with at least a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. Add <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Start a discussion on HTML5 tags. Provide link about where to find out more…</p>
              <p>Also talk about <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> … next week we’ll look at <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>’s and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>’s and a few more things.</p>
              <p><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;div id=“footer”&gt;</code> — this is a difference we’ll talk about in more detail in two weeks when we start getting into some real CSS stuff.</p>
