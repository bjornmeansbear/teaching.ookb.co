          <h1>IM1 Week 4 (9/23/2014)</h1>

            <p>Today we're going to use IDs, classes, positioning and z-index.</p>
            <p>We're going to continue to talk about how a browser "flows" through your HTML document, and what these new CSS techniques do to change that. We'll also continue to review the basics we covered the last two weeks, like floats, etc.</p>

                    <h3>Readings</h3>
                    <p>I was going to assign specific chapters from <cite>Don't make me think</cite>, but the whole thing takes just a day or two to read, so I figured we can read the whole thing over the next couple weeks.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>For 9/30 read Ch1–5</li>
                      <li>For 10/7 read Ch6–8</li>
                      <li>For 10/14 read Ch9–11</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We'll spend a little bit of time each following week discussing important ideas from the text, so make notes of things that made you say "aha," key things you think will be important for web pages in general, and maybe even some common sense things that you're surprised are applicable online...</p>
                  </li>

                    <h3>The Long Scroll </h3>
                    <p>This is the first "legit" project. You'll need to come up with or find enough content to make one really long webpage (this could be partially done via it's design/layout as well). </p>
                    <p>we'll work on this for the next couple of weeks — tentative due date, 10/14/2014</p>
                    <p>For next week, 9/30/2014, Figure out what content you want to use, and find an example of this idea that you like for reference.
                    <ol>
                      <li>Some sort of fixed menu</li>
                      <li>Use anchors and ids to move up and down (or left and right) around the sections of your page</li>
                      <li>At least 4 "sections"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Some Examples...</h4>
                    <ul class="longscroll">
                      <!-- list of long scroll examples printed via Jquery here... -->
                    </ul>
                  </li>

            <p>sidenote: let's make a <a href="demos/starter.html">"starter"</a> file that we can leave empty and then just copy over to any new projects we do (at least for the next couple of weeks)</p>
            <p>We're going to play around with the idea of positioning and turn <a href="demos/position/index.html">this</a> into <a href="demos/position/final.html">this</a>
