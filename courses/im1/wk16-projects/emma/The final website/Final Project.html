       <h1>History </h1>
       <p>Harbin (här´bĬn), Rus. Kharbin, city (1994 est. pop. 2,505,200), capital of Heilongjiang prov., China, on the Songhua River. It is the major trade and communications center of central Manchuria, the junction of the two most important railroads in Manchuria, and the main port on the Songhua. Part of the great Manchurian industrial complex of metallurgical, machinery, chemical, petroleum, and coal industries, Harbin also has railroad shops, food-processing establishments (soybeans are a major commodity), and plants making tractors, turbines, boilers, precision instruments, electrical and electronic equipment, cement, and fertilizer.</p>

<p>Harbin was unimportant until Russia was granted a concession (1896) and built a modern section alongside the old Chinese town. (Russia surrendered its concession in 1924.) Flooded by White Russian refugees after 1917, Harbin had one of the largest European populations in East Asia. Most of the Europeans left the city following the rise to power of the Chinese Communists. Harbin's institutions of higher learning include Harbin Polytechnical Univ., a medical college, and several technical institutes. The city has a well-known winter ice festival.</p>

They are all delicious and sold at low prices. Tossed dishes (like salad) are also popular, and various materials are used, the most common are potato, green pepper, dried bean milk cream in tight rolls, and black fungus, and are usually dressed with soy sauce and aged vinegar.

<h3>Khleb and Smoked Red Sausages</h3>
<p>Khleb is a kind of Russian bread. It is big and round, as heavy as 2.5 kilograms (5.5lb). It tastes fragrant with hard shell but soft inside. The ingredients for this bread are flour, salt and hops. Khleb is convenient for carrying and storage. Hongchang (smoked red sausages) are made with lean meat. Because they are smoked with wood, there is a thin cover of charcoal dust over them. But do not think they are dirty, because it is with this dust that you can taste the true smoking flavor. When eating the Hongchang, you can also make a sandwich with the Khleb.</p>

<p>They are sold in lots of bread and pastry stores in the city, especially Central Avenue. A famous brand is "Churin", with chain stores almost everywhere to be found in Harbin.</p>
