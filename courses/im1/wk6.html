          <h1>IM1 Week 5 (9/30/2014)</h1>

            <p>Today we're going to make a killer long scroll website.</p>
            <p>We're going to continue to talk about how a browser "flows" through your HTML document, and what these new CSS techniques do to change that. We'll also continue to review the basics we covered the last two weeks, like floats, positioning, z-index, etc.</p>
            <p>Oh, and we'll also talk a bit about usability!</p>

                    <p>We'll spend a little bit of time each following week discussing important ideas from the text, so make notes of things that made you say "aha," key things you think will be important for web pages in general, and maybe even some common sense things that you're surprised are applicable online...</p>

                    <h3>The Long Scroll </h3>
                    <p>This is the first "legit" project. You'll need to come up with or find enough content to make one really long webpage (this could be partially done via it's design/layout as well). </p>
                    <p>we'll work on this for the next couple of weeks — tentative due date, 10/14/2014</p>
                    <p>For next week, 10/07/2014, start coding and styling your content</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Some sort of fixed menu</li>
                      <li>Use anchors and ids to move up and down (or left and right) around the sections of your page</li>
                      <li>At least 4 "sections"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Some Examples...</h4>
                    <ul class="longscroll">
                      <!-- list of long scroll examples printed via Jquery here... -->
                    </ul>
                  </li>
