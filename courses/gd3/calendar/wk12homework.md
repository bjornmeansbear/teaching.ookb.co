### Homework
- [Animated Identity](/projects/2013-11-13-animated-identity)
- [Animated Indentity Project Sheet]({{urls.media}}/projects/animatedid.pdf)
- No class next week. 
- For the following week please have decided the following three things:  
a) you must have picked what you are creating the identity for (let me know ASAP if you can't think of something, I can assign you an entity to work with).  
b) You must have picked out/decided upon/designed your kit of parts you will be working with… Basically, these are your visual “rules” that you'll be designing by. Rules based on combining them, moving them around, etc. can be evolved as we move forward.  
c) Decided what kind of animation you are creating. (is the logo itself in motion, does the animation generate your static materials, or does the animation merely explain how your system works…)
