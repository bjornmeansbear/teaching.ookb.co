<h1 id="toc_0">Graphic Design 3.</h1>

<p>This class is an overview and is super basic. You need to spend a lot of time with this stuff on your own outside of class to really start to “get it.” The 16 weeks we spend in here is not enough to make any of you experts… However, don&#39;t be discouraged if you cannot get something or do not know how to make something… Just keep trying! Just play around, just make!</p>

<p>When you find readings that you like, you should read either the rest of that book, or more from that author, or whatever… that’s part of learning to learn…</p>

<p>Things to think about:
- Any better/more readings?
- What about bringing animation to the web? should we at least talk about that one or two days?
- Where does the relativity talk fit in?
- Discuss “time” as a design tool in more detail; same goes with motion…
- What does motion look like when it is static? (if motion is change over time, does there then literally have to be some sort of change?)
- Better overview of historic art &amp; design movements that have captured this content or dealt with these ideas in some way … or as some aspect of the works/movements…
- Temporal understanding in the context of completing a project?</p>

<p>+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+</p>

<p>Other project ideas:
some sort of timeline project?
    - timeline/info graphic?
    - look up skill share noun project icon timeline thingy…</p>
