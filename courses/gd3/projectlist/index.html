      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-09-11-animated-frames">01. Animated Frames</a></h2>
      <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>The purpose of this project is to give you some fundamentals of &ldquo;Frame-by-frame&rdquo; or traditional animation, and then how you can use that in a design context. The main objective is for you to produce a frame-by-frame animation of at least 100 frames. Stylistically it can be whatever you choose. Hopefully, you will begin to understand some alternate methods of animation and the complexities contained within each.</p>

      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-10-02-animated-shapes">02. Animated Shapes</a></h2>
      <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Using only shape layers, the shape tool and plain, formal elements, please make a short animation set to music. Pick a piece of (preferably) instrumental music. Make what you consider to be a &ldquo;Motion Graphic&rdquo; with the skills we've learned so far in After Effects that shows us what the music &ldquo;looks like&rdquo; with your formal and motion choices. If necessary, a jpg or video footage may be used as a background - but strive to use just formal elements. Consider pacing, rhythm, and how formal decisions relate to temporal ones.</p>

      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-10-16-animated-word">03. Animated Word</a></h2>
      <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>This project is about using time and motion as emotive and descriptive forces. How does one make the design, layout, and animation of a thing define it? There are two components to this project: a printed book and a digital animation. The booklet is an opportunity to explore ideas, type, design directions, etc. The end goal here is to convey the meaning of an action verb in a constrained, printed form. The animation has the same goal: show an action verbs definition through design; but now you have the advantage of getting to actually animate the text. Think of these two works as companion pieces. Together they hopefully make each other better.</p>

      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-11-13-animated-identity">04. Animated Identity</a></h2>
      <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>With more and more content moving to web, touch, + video arenas, brands + logos no longer need to remain static. This project requires you to pick a company or product (or even yourself) that would benefit from a contemporary, motion-based re-branding. If you don't have any good ideas for a product or company, just pick the class, GD3. As part of this choice, you must be able to describe &ldquo;why&rdquo; adding motion to this identity better represents the chosen brand. You also need to be clear how this can potentially be expanded to include product line expansion or business growth&hellip;</p>

      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-11-21-design-a-mation">05. Design-a-Mations</a></h2>
      <div class="summary"><p>Ongoing over the term. By the last day of class please have made (at least) 8 short animations that deal with aspects of design that you enjoy&hellip; This means they can be formal explorations, actually try to tackle a subject, whatever. As you send them in, I'll populate our &ldquo;Design-a-Mation&rdquo; page with them.</p></div>

      <h2><a href="/projects/2013-11-22-tmgd-essay">06. Time and Motion and Graphic Design: the essay</a></h2>
      <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>Please explain what you think describes what &ldquo;Time + Motion&rdquo; mean in relation to Graphic Design. We&rsquo;ve spend a lot of time over the term talking about this, but I want to make sure that you all really think about it on your own; as well as think about how you might explain it to someone else.</p>
