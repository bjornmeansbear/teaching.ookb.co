<p>Design is increasingly living in all places and mediums simultaneously and we Graphic Designers must be aware of and ready for the conceptual and technological implications that come along with this. The goals of this class are to try and clarify and explain these implications; cover the broader concepts of time and motion and their connection to all facets of a design practice; and begin to introduce software, tricks, and techniques for creating motion design.</p>

<p>This course travels broadly but shallowly. I will (hopefully) pique your interests on many things, but we do not have enough time to delve into any of them very intensely. There are too many interesting things to try and get to, so more than 2 or 3 weeks cannot be spent on any one thing. Intense practice and study will have to be at each of your own impetus. </p>

<p>Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects will be our main tools — but flipbooks, HTML5/JS/CSS3, Processing as well as some other applications and processes will be discussed. We’ll look at both historic and contemporary examples of designers using film, animation, and temporal tools and methods in their work will be referenced to help frame our discussions and projects. </p>

<p>Motion Graphics are still Graphic Design. You do not have to think of this class as covering something else. While we are learning things about Animated Gifs or After Effects or Relativity we are still learning about form, narrative, typography, etc. Do not let the fact that we’ll be using potentially new mediums and ideas upset the design principles you have already learned.</p>
