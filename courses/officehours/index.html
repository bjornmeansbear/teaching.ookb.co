Tuesdays 2–4pm  </p>

<p>I’ll probably be around more than just those hours on Tuesday Mornings and Afternoons during the whole semester. I’ll also generally be around Wed, Thurs, and Friday afternoons until 5 or so after my morning classes.</p>

<p>It’s best if you can email me and let me know you’d like to talk so students don’t show up at the same time and have to wait — but please feel free to stop by and ask me questions or voice your concerns whenever you see that I’m in my office.</p>
