<p>Unless otherwise indicated by the instructor, students are expected to attend all meetings of each class in which they are enrolled. They are expected to be ready to start work at the opening of class and to remain for the entire class session.</p>

<p>Irregular attendance or habitual tardiness usually leads to lower grades and, ultimately, to probation or dismissal. Although an instructor&#39;s discretion is clearly involved, unexcused absence from as few as three classes will result in a failing grade.</p>

<p>In the case of extended illness or other legitimate absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs so that instructors can be notified.</p>

<p>IF YOU MISS MORE THAN THREE CLASSES THEN YOU DO NOT PASS THIS COURSE. This isn’t my decision, it is MICA policy across the board — if you miss 4 class sessions you get withdrawn from the course, this means you don’t get credit for it.
If you miss a class, check the course website. I will be posting info on what we discussed and files or readings you might need. If you have additional questions contact me immediately; please don’t wait until the next week. You will still be expected to present or be prepared for the following class after any absence.
It is also important you show up to class on time and prepared. We’ve got a lot to cover and it sets the whole class behind when any of you shows up late. However, being late —even 2 hours late — is favorable to not coming at all.
Since I am teaching all 3 sessions of GD3 this fall, you could potentially make up a missed class by attending another section that week. If you have a legitimate reason for needing to miss a class, please take advantage of this and let me know in advance if possible.</p>
