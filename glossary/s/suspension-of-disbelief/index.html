<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">Suspension of disbelief</a> or “willing suspension of disbelief” is a formula for justifying the use of fantastic or non-realistic elements in literature. It was put forth in English by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a &quot;human interest and a semblance of truth&quot; into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. The phrase &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the onus was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. It might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These fictional premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.</p>
