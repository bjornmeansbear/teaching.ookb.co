The three laws that form the basis for Classical Mechanics. They enable the prediction of the path of any object from a grain of sand to a planet:

1. A body will remain at rest or move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force.
2. The acceleration of a body is proportional to the applied force. This is expressed by the universal formula: Force = mass × acceleration.
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
