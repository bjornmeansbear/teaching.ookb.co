<p>The three laws that form the basis for Classical Mechanics. They enable the prediction of the path of any object from a grain of sand to a planet:</p>

<ol>
<li>A body will remain at rest or move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force.</li>
<li>The acceleration of a body is proportional to the applied force. This is expressed by the universal formula: Force = mass Ã— acceleration.</li>
<li>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
</ol>
