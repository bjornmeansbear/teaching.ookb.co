title: "02. Animated Shapes"
---

Using only shape layers, the shape tool and plain, formal elements, please make a short animation set to music. Pick a piece of (preferably) instrumental music. Make what you consider to be a “Motion Graphic” with the skills we've learned so far in After Effects that shows us what the music “looks like” with your formal and motion choices. If necessary, a jpg or video footage may be used as a background - but strive to use just formal elements. Consider pacing, rhythm, and how formal decisions relate to temporal ones.

### Reference:
**Shape layer basics.**
[After Effects Apprentice 14 - Shape Layers](http://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-CS5-tutorials/After-Effects-Apprentice-14-Shape-Layers/79643-2.html)
Get through at least chapters 1, 2, and 3, Shape Layers, Multiple Shape Paths, and Shape Effects… This will give everyone a good foundation for starting to play around with shape layers. But you can do the whole thing if you want.
