This project is about using time and motion as emotive and descriptive forces. How does one make the design, layout, and animation of a thing define it?

There are two components to this project:
- a 32 page booklet
- an animation

The booklet is an opportunity to explore ideas, type, design directions, etc. The end goal here is to convey the meaning of an action verb in a constrained, printed form.

The animation has the same goal: show an action verbs definition through design; but now you have the advantage of getting to actually animate the text.

Think of these two works as companion pieces. Together they hopefully make each other better.

### CRITERIA

- Choose an action verb from the provided list.
- Look up the word in your dictionary of choice.
- Choose one of the definitions for that verb.

#### FOR THE BOOKLET
- Make a 32 page booklet that helps us to understand your action verb and its definition through typographic exercise and other graphic means.
- Treat this as a design piece of its own, but also a tool to help test and experiment with graphic means of conveying motion and emotion.

#### FOR THE ANIMATION
Using the same verb and definition from the booklet, animate said verb using After effects so that the animation techniques/styles visually explain the definition. (If you are against using after effects for some reason, one of the other animation methods we've discussed may also be used — stop motion, animated gifs, actual video, or something of your own devising). Easy.

The constraints are as follows:
- Use just your word.
- Use two colors.
- No other graphics allowed.

There isn’t a duration requirement. Just use a single action verb, and do a good job of animating your word so that the class can figure out the definition you’ve chosen. I would like it if you included the definition in the animation; but you don't have to if you don’t think it is necessary. Using minimal palette, simple type, basic graphic forms — if any — and focussing your energies on making sure your animation is well crafted and truly embodies your word will be to your benefit.

You will probably be better off creating the letters yourself, or picking a typeface with simpler forms if you plan on doing a lot of manipulation.

### CHOOSING ACTION VERBS

[Action verbs are something that a person, animal, force of nature, or thing can do](http://www.chompchomp.com/terms/actionverb.htm). They are mainly used alone as the main verb of a sentence e.g. run, jump, reach, swim, walk, fell etc. Action verbs can also be actions you can’t see such as “thought” or “want.”

Please choose one action verb from the following list, and find a definition for it. Some of these words are not just verbs. Take “Spell” for example: you can cast a spell, you can vacation for a spell, or you can spell a word). The first two uses are nouns, not verbs, so when you are looking for a word’s definition, make sure you pick the definition for spell as a verb — e.g.: to name, write, or otherwise give the letters, in order, of a word NOT a word, phrase, or form of words supposed to have magic power NOR a continuous course or period of work or other activity … make sense?
