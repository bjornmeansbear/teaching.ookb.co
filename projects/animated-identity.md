title: "4. Animated Identity"
---

With more and more content moving to web, touch, + video arenas, brands + logos no longer need to remain static. This project requires you to pick a company or product (or even yourself) that would benefit from a contemporary, motion-based re-branding. If you don't have any good ideas for a product or company, just pick the class, GD3. As part of this choice, you must be able to describe “why” adding motion to this identity better represents the chosen brand. You also need to be clear how this can potentially be expanded to include product line expansion or business growth…

We’ll then look at how the concepts of time + motion can help to get across a message, as well as how to apply something meant for motion to static objects.

We’ll also use the work your doing on this project each week for learning additional techniques and concepts. Thus, you need to be making progress each week to be able to properly participate in class. The demos we do in class will directly relate to readings, lectures and presentations that should provide further direction and ideas to your projects.

The outcome should not just be a "logo in motion" for no reason… thus, these examples ARE NOT the acceptable outcomes. None of these animations use the Motion in the logo for any particular reason other than to just be animated… Please look in the actual "examples" section for what would be considered acceptable…
