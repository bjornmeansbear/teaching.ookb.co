Using only the shape tool and plain, formal elements, please make a short animation set to music.
Pick a piece of instrumental music. 
Make what you consider to be a “Motion Graphic” with the skills we've learned so far. 
Attempt to show us what the music sounds like with your formal and motion choices.

Need to know to complete (more or less):
- Nesting
- Precomping
- Parenting
- Solid layers
- Masks
- Shape layers
- Simple transitions (like wipes - radial and linear)
- Bringing in PSD and AI files

We'll be going over this in class and in assigned demos the next couple weeks so you can make this happen

Criteria:

- Use shapes and graphic forms only.
- You can use shape layers, masks, and solids, but are only allowed to play with the shape and arrow tools. Don't worry about type or anything else special.
- No shorter than 15 sec.
- No longer than 1 min.
- Please add sound — I can provide short instrumental tracks you can use if you don't have something of your own.
