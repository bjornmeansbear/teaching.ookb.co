title: "04. Animated Identity"
requirements: 
  - "a Kit-of-parts"
  - "Show how the System or Kit of Parts works"
  - "Video of the Animation: an Animation that either generates the logo, explains the system, or IS the logo"
  - "Example of how it is used when in motion (on a website, part of TV program, instructional video, whatever)"
  - "Static Examples (i'll clarify what this means when we meet again after thxgiving)"
  - "Explain how the animation of the identity increases the meaning of the brand or product or entity you've chosen. Have an answer to the question: why add motion to this?"
examples:
  - "../courses/gd3/calendar/#wk12"

With more and more content moving to web, mobile and video arenas, brands and logos must no longer remain static. This project requires you to pick a company or product (or even yourself) that would benefit from a contemporary, motion-based re-branding. If you don't have any good ideas for a product or company, you could even just pick the class, GD3; or, let me know and I can assign something to you. As part of this choice, you must be able to describe “why” adding motion to this identity better represents the chosen brand. You also need to be clear how this can potentially be expanded by showing us some guidelines and various uses.

# DUE:
This assignment is due the last day of class:  
Wed sec1: 2013-12-18  
Thu sec2: 2013-12-19  
Fri sec3: 2013-12-20  
```

We’ll look at how the concepts of time + motion can be applied to a logo, as well as how to apply something meant for motion to static objects.

We’ll also use the work your doing on this project each week for learning additional techniques and concepts. Thus, you need to be making progress each week to be able to properly participate in class. The demos, discussions, and exercises we do in class will directly relate to readings, lectures and presentations that should provide further direction and ideas to your projects over the last few weeks.

The outcome should not just be a "logo in motion" for no reason, thus, [these examples ARE NOT the acceptable outcomes](http://www.spinmylogo.com/spinmylogo/Spin_My_Logo____logo_animation_services.html). None of these animations use the Motion in the logo for any particular reason other than to just be animated. Please look at the [various examples I reference in Week 12](../courses/gd3/calendar/#wk12) for what would be considered acceptable…


### What to Think About: 
#### Where does this animation live?
Is this simply a logo that has been set into motion, or do the building blocks of the logo/animation actively inhabit other spaces?

- perhaps the background of a webpage
- just a little brand video like Cooper Union
- an activated logo sitting stationary in the masthead of a website
- some sort of video poster?
- anywhere else?

#### Kit of Parts
It would be best if you all try to use a kit of parts. This really systematizes the process. Think about systematizing color, shapes, elements, and movements. This will provide you with ample material to apply to the motion elements, while easily creating rules for applying chosen moments or graphic elements of animation to static objects.

Once you start getting the building blocks figured out, the rest should mostly just build itself.

“Systems” are still designed, up front you still should consider the relationship of the formal discussions you've made to your content, the brand and your concepts…

#### How/What is going to be animated?
Motion capabilities

Print capabilities - whatever is in motion, this stuff has to also work still in print, and anywhere else it might get used…

#### Why the Motion?
Is this a single animation? does this loop? etc.
