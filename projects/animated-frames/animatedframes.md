The purpose of this project is to give you some fundamentals of “Frame-by-frame” or traditional animation …

You can make this a legit stop-motion, or you can manufacture all the frames in illustrator, indesign, or similar. Please DO NOT use an actual animation software or tweening tools however — only stop motion, photoshop, illustrator, indesign, or any sort of hand creation are allowed.

You must at minimum have 150 frames.

We'll go over clever ways to turn a bunch of jpegs into a video file as well as other potential ways to convert what you have into playable videos…

The content of this project must be your interpretation of the various laws of motion and other fundamentals we've been discussing. Perhaps something explaining Newton's laws? perhaps something about Aristotles view that any kind of change is motion … or perhaps something that contains all 7 basic kinds of motion. This is up to you as long as you can explain how it does something of this sort…

## Requirements
1. Minimum 150 frames
2. Use the animation to tackle your take on the content we've been discussing…
3. No automated TWEENING allowed.
4. Deliver in .mov, .psd, or .gif formats (or something else that is collectable in 1 file and allows for universal playback)
