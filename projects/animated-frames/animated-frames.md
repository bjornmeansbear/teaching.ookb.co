The purpose of this project is to give you some fundamentals of “Frame-by-frame” or traditional animation, and then how you can use that in a design context.

You can make this a legit stop-motion, or you can manufacture all the frames in illustrator, indesign, or similar. Please DO NOT use an actual animation software or automatic tweening tools however — only stop motion, photoshop, illustrator, indesign, or any sort of hand creation are allowed. Part of the point of this is to show how simple, even if slightly time intensive making “motion” design can be, and allow you the comfort of tools you are already used to.

You must have 100 frames. No less, and preferably not much more...

We'll go over clever ways to turn a bunch of jpegs into a video file as well as other potential ways to convert what you have into playable videos…

The content of this project must be your interpretation of the various laws of motion and other fundamentals we've been discussing. Perhaps something explaining Newton's laws? perhaps something about Aristotles view that any kind of change is motion; or perhaps something that contains all 7 basic kinds of motion. This is up to you as long as you can explain how it does something of this sort.

## Requirements
1. 100 frames
2. Use the animation to tackle your take on the content we've been discussing…
3. No automated TWEENING allowed.
4. Deliver in .mov or .gif formats (or something else that is collectable in 1 file or archive and allows for universal playback — like an html/js slideshow)
