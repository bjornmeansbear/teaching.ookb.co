requirements:
  - "Size of 640 x 480 px"
  - "Frame rate: 24, 25, or 30 FPS"
  - "You must have 100 frames. Certainly no less, and preferably not much more."
  - "No automated TWEENING allowed"
  - "Use the animation to tackle your take on the content we’ve been discussing thus far"
  - "Deliver in .mov, .gif formats (or something else that is collectable in 1 file or archive, and allows for universal playback, like a web slideshow)"
  - "post your work to Vimeo.com, send me a link to where an online slideshow can be viewed, or bring a .mov or .gif file to class"

# DUE:
This assignment will run for 2 weeks. We'll look at people's completed animations on:
Wed sec1: 2013-09-25
Thu sec2: 2013-09-26
Fri sec3: 2013-09-27
```

The purpose of this project is to give you some fundamentals of “Frame-by-frame” or traditional animation, and then how you can use that in a design context. The main objective is for you to produce a frame-by-frame animation of at least 100 frames. Stylistically it can be whatever you choose. Hopefully, you will begin to understand some alternate methods of animation and the complexities contained within each.

You can make this a legit stop-motion, or you can manufacture all the frames in illustrator, indesign, or similar. Please DO NOT use an actual animation software or automatic tweening tools however — only stop motion, photoshop, illustrator, indesign, or any sort of hand creation are allowed — you must manufacture each frame. Part of the point of this is to show how simple, even if slightly time intensive, making motion design can be, and allow you the comfort of tools you are hopefully already used to.

You may work with 3D objects and space, 2D objects and space, or a combination of both. Make the objects as abstract or personified as you like. Play with movement, color, form, and how those all relate to concept and content.

If using a camera, the camera should be stationary for all of your shots. Use a tripod for maximum control and flexibility.

We'll go over clever ways to turn a bunch of jpegs into a video file as well as other potential ways to convert what you have into playable videos. All work for this assignment will in the end be digitized. Work not done on the computer will need to be scanned, photographed, etc. so as to be able to be digitized for final viewing form.

The content of this project must be your interpretation of the various laws of motion and other fundamentals we've been discussing. Perhaps something explaining Newton's laws? perhaps something about Aristotle’s view that any kind of change is motion; or perhaps something that contains all 7 basic kinds of motion. This is up to you as long as you can explain how it does something of this sort.
