Ongoing over the term.  
By the last day of class please have made (at least) 8 short animations that deal with aspects of design that you enjoyâ€¦ This means they can be formal explorations, actually try to tackle a subject, whatever. But they must adhere to the following constraints:

- Animated GIF or JPEG sequence
- 480x320 px
- 20 frames or less.
