# Design-a-Mations

Ongoing over the term.
By the last day of class please have made (at least) 10 short animations that deal with aspects of design that you enjoyâ€¦ This means they can be formal explorations, actually try to tackle a subject, whatever. But they must adhere to the following constraints:

- Animated GIF format
- SOME SPECIFIC SIZE
- Some other arbitrary constraint.
